# Final-Project-gic_rates_generator
CS5001 Final Project:

This project is made to help people calculate their expected return for amount and time they want to invest in GIC for. 
When user inputs terms and amount they want to invest in, this program would generate rates for them followed by expected returns at maturity. This will also allow you to compare different rates for multiple terms so you can make the best choice that fits your timeline.
