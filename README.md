# Final-Project-gic_rates_generator
CS5001 Final Project
This project is made to help people calculate their expected return for amount and time they want to invest in GIC for. 
When user inputs terms, amount, and types of GIC, this program would generate a rate for them followed by expected return at maturity. This will also allow you to compare different rates for multiple terms so you can make the best choice that fits your timeline.
